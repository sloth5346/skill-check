The future starts today, not tomorrow.
Conquer yourself rather than the world.
Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving.
Happiness depends upon ourselves.
Fear always springs from ignorance.
The most important thing in communication is hearing what isn't said.
Experience is not what happens to you. It is what you do with what happens to you.
Peace begins with a smile.
Love is doing small things with great love.
My true religion is kindness.
Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.
